# logo

**This package is not unit-tested and not intended for distribution with the PySAL-meta package.**

### Description
     * Create the PySAL logo with TeX/TikZ, then create favicons at specified resolutions with ImageTricks. The original logo design was based on Figure 1 from Rey and Anselin (2007). Examples are given within `create_logo()` and `create_favicon()`. Further examples can be found in `PySAL_logo_creation.ipynb`.
