# logo

**This package is not unit-tested and not intended for distribution with the PySAL-meta package.**

### Description
  * Create the PySAL logo with TeX/TikZ, then create favicons at specified resolutions with ImageTricks. The original logo design was based on Figure 1 from Rey and Anselin (2007). Examples are given within [`create_logo()`](https://github.com/pysal/logo/blob/master/logo/create_pysal_logo.py#L53) and [`create_favicon()`](https://github.com/pysal/logo/blob/5616bf4d4fd45f9d08f16ddb87af306411001c34/logo/create_pysal_logo.py#L212). Further examples can be found in [`PySAL_logo_creation.ipynb`](https://github.com/pysal/logo/blob/master/PySAL_logo_creation.ipynb).
